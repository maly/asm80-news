2.5.0
=====

Partial includes
----------------

Now you can include not only the whole file, but only a part of file. This is achieved by the concept of "named block".

Let's have a file "library.a80":

```
.block serout
; a routine for serial output
@putchar:
...
.endblock

.block serin
;a routine for serial input
@getchar
...
.endblock
```

In your file, e.g. "main.a80", you can include the whole file with `.include library.a80`. Now you can include only the needed parts using a special naming convention _file:block_.

```
.include library.a80:serout
call putchar:
...
```

It includes only the block "serout" (with a global label putchar, in our case). Other blocks will be omitted.

Include local block
-------------------

You can reference the actual included file by the placeholder _this_. Let's add a "serial init" to our library:

```
...
.block serinit
;serial port init
@uart_init:
...
.endblock
```

Now you can add the "dependency" with a little bit modification of our library:

```
.block serout
; a routine for serial output
.include this:serinit
@putchar:
...
.endblock

.block serin
;a routine for serial input
.include this:serinit
@getchar:
...
.endblock

.block serinit
;serial port init
@uart_init:
...
.endblock
```

Don't worry, the init code will be included only once!
