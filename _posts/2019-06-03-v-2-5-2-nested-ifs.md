title: Version 2.5.2 - nested IFs and better macros
---

This version brings you a two big news. The first is the possibility of nested IFs. So you can write constructions like:

```
IF foo
 ...something
 IF bar
 ...something
 ELSE
 ...something else
 ENDIF
ELSE
 ...something
ENDIF
```  

The second improvement is the slightly enriched syntax for the macros.

Old form is `.macro name`. New macro can be defined as `name: .macro` or `name .macro`.

Now you can name formal parameters too. For example - assume a macro cpymem for copy memory content. Such macro has three arguments - source, destination and length. The old form of macro has _mute parameters_, just referenced by its number:

```
.macro cpymem
LD HL,%%1
LD DE,%%2
LD BC,%%3
LDIR
.endm
```

New formal parameters, introduced in revision 2.5.2, allows to write this:

```
.macro cpymem, src, dst, len
LD HL,src
LD DE,dst
LD BC,len
LDIR
.endm
```

Preprocessor also check if the number of given parameters is sufficient for the macro, i.e. you cannot specify less parameters than formal, like `cpymem 100, 200`.

All those named parameters are strictly local (in fact, they are replaced with its values before assembly phase).
