title: Version 2.5.3 - floats
---

There is just one update: enable floating point (FP) numbers in the expressions.

It brings three new PRAGMAs:

| pragma | meaning |
+ ------ + ------- +
| .pragma nofloat | all float numbers are stripped down to the integer (just drop all the digits after the decimal point) |
| .pragma float | leave FP numbers intact |
| .pragma roundfloat | all FP numbers are rounded to their nearest integer |
